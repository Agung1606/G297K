* Introduction
  - I created this social media for the purpose of learning and exploring technology
  - The technology behind the scenes is React Native and Firebase

## Features

  - Users can create an account by providing their email and password.

  - Users can view a feed of posts from other users.
  - Each post includes the username, profile picture, post content, and timestamp.
  - Posts are fetched from Firestore and displayed in a scrollable list.
